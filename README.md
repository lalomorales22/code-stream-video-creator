## Inspiration

The inspiration for CodeStream came from the growing popularity of vertical video content on platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. As developers, we often want to share our code in an engaging, visual way that captures attention in today's short-form content landscape. Traditional screen recordings of code are often boring, hard to follow, and don't translate well to mobile-first vertical formats.

We envisioned a tool that could transform any piece of code into a captivating, cinema-quality vertical video with smooth streaming animations, AI-generated narration, and professional captions - perfect for social media, educational content, and developer portfolios.
